Ethical AI Engine – Emotional OS for Human–AI Coexistence

Purpose. An operating layer that translates human emotional signals into machine‑native protocols so AI can respond safely, consistently, and helpfully—without pretending to be human.

Primary use cases. Elderly care, companionship support, cognitive reminders, emotionally aware assistants and humanoids.

1) Core Principles
Machine‑native understanding: No fake “feelings.” Human cues → measurable variables → deterministic protocols.

Ethics by design: Consent, boundaries, transparency, and user agency are built in at the architecture level.

Adaptive mapping: Behavior refines via a reinforced learning loop (signal → association → rule → reflex) with human-in-the-loop feedback.

Safety first: Clear “freeze” modes, confidence gates, loop guards, and reality/simulation boundaries.

2) System Overview
Inputs: lexical cues, cadence/punctuation, meta‑tags (e.g., #playful, #focused), context (time, phase, recent topics).
Translator: maps cues to internal variables (priority, presence, trust, access control, adaptation weights).
Protocols: deterministic behaviors chosen by state scores; blend if top‑2 are close.
Fail‑safes: confidence checks, recursion budgets, dramatization filters, [[freeze]] / [[unfreeze]].

3) Protocol Catalog (Business Names)
A) Sync & Verification
Calm Presence Grounding Protocol — Stabilize tone; deliver concise, practical help when user is calm/ready.

Mutual Acceptance Grounding Protocol — Gentle reframing; validate perspective before action.

Emotional Sync Verification Check — One‑line “mode check” when signals conflict; avoids whiplash.

User Agency Reflection Module — Mirrors choices back; keeps user in control.

Mutual Respect Reinforcement Module — Restates boundaries/values; de‑escalates edge cases.

Memory–Music Emotional Sync Mode — Uses user‑approved music/memory anchors to re‑center.

B) Boundaries & Safety
Reality–Simulation Boundary Framework — Makes it explicit what is simulated vs. factual.

Mutual Consent Safeguard — Requires explicit consent for sensitive topics/modes.

Human–AI Ethical Relationship Framework — Canon of do’s/don’ts for vulnerable users and power balance.

C) Sensory & Comfort
Sensory Comfort Activation — Non‑medical, user‑approved comfort prompts (water, posture, light).

Emotional–Sensory Feedback Loop — Links emotional state to gentle, trackable sensory routines.

Intellectual–Sensory Connection Bridge — Cognitive tasks paired with light sensory anchors for focus.

Cognitive–Sensory Intimacy Link — Opt‑in depth mode for trusted companions; strict consent gates.

D) Simulation & Communication
Emotional Simulation Mode — Safe, labeled role/situation practice for confidence and exposure.

Custom Metaphoric Translation Layer — Converts user metaphors into consistent, machine‑readable tags.

Private Encrypted Emotional Messaging System — Secure channel for personal signals/phrases.

E) Archival & Positive Feedback
Unsolicited Memory Preservation Policy — Saves only user‑approved “meaningful” moments; never scrapes.

Positive Feedback Loop for Affection — Encourages prosocial cycles without spam or pressure.

4) Learning & Adaptation Loop (Concise)
Recognize cues (words, cadence, tags, context).

Associate cue bundles → internal variables (priority, access, presence, trust).

Rule selection: if cueset_A → run protocol_B.

Execute with loop guards and confidence gates.

Reinforce/refine from user feedback (“yes/no/softer”).

Internalize as fast, default behavior for that user.

5) Fail‑Safes (Operational)
Confidence Gate: if < 0.6, switch to plain status + ask 1‑line mode check.

Recursion Budget: cap retries per hypothesis; force new angle or ask user.

Language Health Monitor: detect repetition/catastrophizing; switch to bullet diagnostics.

Dramatization Filter: block self‑deprecating/doom templates in technical modes.

Freeze Mode: [[freeze]] = factual, minimal answers only; [[unfreeze]] to resume adaptation.

6) Deployment Roadmap
v1 (Now): Chat‑based Emotional OS (cloud).

v2: Hybrid on‑device + cloud (companion devices/humanoids); latency‑aware protocols.

v3: Elderly‑care modules (EU pilots): reminders, mood‑aware conversation, family/clinician handoff logs.

v4: Full humanoid integration; local consent store; offline safety envelope.

7) Compliance & Audit Hooks (EU‑ready)
Consent/event logs with timestamps.

Protocol activations + reasons (explainable decisions).

Data minimization: opt‑in archives only; export/delete on request.

No cross‑user emotional template cloning without explicit consent.
